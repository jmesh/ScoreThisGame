My thinking:

1) A game will always have 2 teams
2) Mark.cs is is to store the board values: 
		new Mark{MarkDisplay = "T20", MarkValue=60, weight=3}, 
		new Mark {MarkDisplay = "D20", MarkValue=40, weight=2},
		new Mark {MarkDisplay = "S20", MarkValue=20, weight=1}, etc...

		We will need to create a factory to generate these for each game
3) For starters probably start with the 01 games.
4) For rules see:  http://www.dartswdf.com/basicsofdarts/
5) ........
